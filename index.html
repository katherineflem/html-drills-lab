        <!--About me-->
        <h1>Biggest heading</h1>
        <p>My name is Katherine Fleming. Some people call me Kathy. Some people call me Flem. I unfortunatley respond to both.</p>

        <!--About my work-->
        <h2>little smaller</h2>
        <p>I currently work at the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, raising money for blood cancer patients. It is very rewarding which is why I got into non-profit but I find myself only enjoying the tasks that give me a chance to problem solve, so I figured coding would be a good thing to jump into.</p>
        <!--About my interests-->
        <h3>just a bit smaller</h3>
        <p>I am interested in coding, obviously or I wouldn't be here. I am very interested in music, good food, books, tv- the normal stuff.</p>
        <!--About New Orleans-->
        <h4>medium</h4>
        <p>Not really sure why I made this a heading. I panicked and just wrote my hometown- which is awesome btw. I love my hometown.</p>
        <!--About Birmingham-->
        <h5>pretty darn small</h5>
        <p>Since I wrote New Orleans I figured I would put where I currently live as of Semptember. I love it here just as much as I love New Orleans. </p>
        <!--About literally anything else-->
